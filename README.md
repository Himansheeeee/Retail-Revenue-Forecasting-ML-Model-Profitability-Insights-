# Retail-Revenue-Forecasting-ML-Model-Profitability-Insights-
Built a Machine Learning model for retail revenue forecasting using AWS (S3, Glue, Athena) and regression techniques. Delivered profitability insights through A/B testing and KPI dashboards, enabling data-driven pricing and revenue strategies.



# ðŸ›’ Retail Revenue Forecasting ML Model & Profitability Insights

### **Step 1: Problem Definition**

* Business Goal â†’ Forecast retail sales revenue to support **inventory planning, pricing strategy, and profitability optimisation**.
* Secondary Goal â†’ Provide insights into profit fluctuations and test pricing strategies using **A/B testing**.

---

### **Step 2: Data Collection**

* Gathered retail sales data (transactions, units sold, pricing, discounts, promotions, competitor pricing, seasonal factors, etc.).
* Stored data on **AWS S3** buckets for centralised access.

---

### **Step 3: Data Preprocessing**

* Used **AWS Glue DataBrew** for data cleaning and transformation.
* Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.
* Created derived variables such as **profit margins, revenue per product, seasonal indicators**.

---

### **Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Analysed historical sales trends across regions, products, and time.
* Identified revenue-driving factors such as **discounts, seasonal demand, and competitor pricing**.
* Visualised KPIs in **Power BI dashboards** (Revenue, Profit, Units Sold, Seasonal Trends).

---

### **Step 5: Feature Engineering**

* Created time-based features: **lag variables, moving averages, rolling means**.
* Encoded categorical variables like product category, region, and promotion type.
* Normalised numeric features for better ML model performance.

---

### **Step 6: Model Development**

* Built regression models to forecast revenue:

  * **Polynomial Regression** for capturing non-linear sales trends.
  * Cross-validation to test model robustness.
* Achieved **97.5% accuracy** in forecasting using historical sales + external variables.

---

### **Step 7: Profitability Insights (A/B Testing)**

* Designed **A/B tests** comparing current vs. alternative pricing/discount strategies.
* Found a **+1.15% revenue uplift** but a **\~520% profit decline**, revealing unsustainable discounting practices.

---

### **Step 8: Dashboard Development & Reporting**

* Built **interactive dashboards** in Power BI with 5+ KPIs: Revenue, Profit, Discount Effectiveness, Seasonal Demand, and Forecast Accuracy.
* Enabled stakeholders to **track profitability and revenue forecasts** in real-time.

---

### **Step 9: Business Recommendations**

* Suggested reducing over-discounting to protect profit margins.
* Recommended dynamic pricing aligned with seasonal demand forecasts.
* Advised scaling ML model for other product categories to support long-term planning.

---

### **Step 10: Deployment & Continuous Improvement**

* Stored processed datasets in **AWS Athena** for querying.
* Designed pipeline for continuous data ingestion and retraining.
* Next steps â†’ Deploy model with **AWS Redshift or SageMaker** for production-scale forecasting.

---

âœ… **End Result:**

* Accurate revenue forecasting (97.5% accuracy).
* Clear profitability insights for management.
* Actionable recommendations for **pricing & inventory strategy**.
